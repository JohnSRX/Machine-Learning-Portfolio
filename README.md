#  K-Means Clustering


K-means clustering is a cool unsupervised learning algorithm that sorts similar data points into clusters. It's like organizing a messy room into neat groups! By assigning points to clusters and adjusting centroids, K-means finds patterns and structures in the data. It's used for customer segmentation, image compression, and more. Let's dive into K-means clustering to unlock insights from our data!
