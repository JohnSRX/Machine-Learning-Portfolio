#  K-Means Clustering


K-means clustering is a cool unsupervised algorithm that groups similar data points together. It works by creating K clusters, where each cluster has a center point called a centroid. The algorithm repeatedly assigns data points to the nearest centroid based on their distance and updates the centroids by recalculating the mean of the assigned points. This process keeps going until the centroids stabilize and the clusters are formed. K-means clustering is used in customer segmentation, image compression, and anomaly detection, among other things. It helps us understand data patterns and organize large datasets.
