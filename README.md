# Feature Engineering


Feature engineering is a vital process in machine learning where we create meaningful features from raw data. By selecting, transforming, and combining variables, we enhance model performance and uncover hidden patterns. It's a continuous journey of discovery and improvement. Let's harness the power of feature engineering for better predictions!
