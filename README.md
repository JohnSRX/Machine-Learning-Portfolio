#  Naive Bayes

Naive Bayes is a smart algorithm that uses probabilities to make decisions. It's commonly used in tasks like text classification to determine categories or sentiments. Naive Bayes assumes feature independence, although this assumption may not always hold in reality. Nonetheless, it performs well, with high speed and efficiency, and can handle large datasets. By leveraging Naive Bayes, we can achieve accurate predictions and gain valuable insights from our data.
