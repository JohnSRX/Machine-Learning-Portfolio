# Association Rules

Association rules in machine learning are like uncovering hidden patterns or relationships in massive datasets. You can think of them as if-then statements, where specific items or groups of items are linked to one another. These rules are evaluated using support and confidence metrics, which determine how frequently the associations occur and how reliable they are. Their practical uses extend across various domains, such as retail and healthcare, where they help analyze patterns and create recommendation systems.
