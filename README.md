# Decision Tree


Decision trees are awesome models that help us make decisions based on data. They create a tree structure where each node represents a feature and each branch leads to an outcome. What's great is that decision trees are easy to understand, can handle different types of data, and find use in classifying and predicting in different fields. They're also the building blocks for more advanced methods.
