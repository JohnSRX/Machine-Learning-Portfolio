#  Regression

Regression is like a helpful tool that allows us to predict things using what we already know. We examine the data and find patterns to make educated guesses about what might come next. Think of regression as the process of joining the dots on a graph using a line or curve. It helps us create a visual representation of data, and also understand different patterns and trends. The closer the line fits the dots, the more accurate our predictions become. We can use regression in various domains, including financial analysis, to understand how factors are linked and make predictions about future outcomes.
