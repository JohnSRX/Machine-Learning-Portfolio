#  Support Vector Machine

SVM is a super powerful machine learning tool that helps us classify or predict data points by drawing a boundary line or surface. It's like creating a wall to separate different groups. SVM finds the best separation by maximizing the distance between the data points and the boundary. It works by mapping the data into a higher-dimensional space and using support vectors to create a strong decision boundary. SVM can handle both simple and complex tasks using different techniques, making it awesome for dealing with all kinds of data. It's used in cool areas like image recognition, text classification, and bioinformatics to classify and predict stuff.
