#  K-Nearest Neighbors


K-nearest neighbors (KNN) is a cool supervised learning algorithm that makes predictions by consulting the wisdom of nearby data points. It's like seeking advice from your closest buddies! KNN finds the K most similar neighbors and goes with the majority vote to make predictions.
KNN is super versatile and finds applications in recommendation systems, image recognition, and more. Just remember to choose the right value for K and preprocess your data for best results.
